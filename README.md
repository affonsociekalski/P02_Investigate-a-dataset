# P02_Investigate-a-dataset
This is the second project from the Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity.

## Project Overview
This [project](investigate-a-dataset.ipynb) summarizes the steps present in the Data Analysis process.
At first, I cleaned and prepared the data. After that, I carried out an 
Exploratory Data Analysis. To sum up, I drew conclusions that answered 
the questions I posed at the beginning. For my project, I chose the 
TMDb Data Set, provided and cleaned by Udacity from the original data on 
Kaggle. It contains thousands of movies with duration, year of release, 
genre, and popularity, among other data.
